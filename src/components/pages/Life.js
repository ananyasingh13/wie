                    <div className="about">
                        <p>Kimberly Bryant excelled at science and mathematics as a child and earned a scholarship to Vanderbilt University. There, she obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree in electrical engineering with minors in mathematics and computer science.
<br/>For more than two decades, Bryant took on technical leadership roles in several pharmaceutical and biotech companies, including Novartis and Merck.
<br/>It wasn't until her daughter showed an interest in computer science that Bryant realized there was still a lack of Black women in the science, technology, engineering and math professions. This gap wasn't due to a lack of interest -- it was due to a lack of access and exposure to STEM topics.
<br/>Bryant founded Black Girls Code in 2011, a San Francisco nonprofit that exposes girls of color ages 7 to 17 to STEM subjects. Here, girls can learn in-demand skills as they think about what they want to be when they grow up. The organization has the goal of teaching 1 million Black girls to code by 2040. Today, the organization has 16 chapters across the United States and one chapter in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p>

                    <div className="about">
                        <p>Safra Catz immigrated to the U.S. from Israel at age 6. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and her Juris Doctor from Penn Law.
                        <br/>Catz was a banker at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, working her way through the ranks to become the managing director, then senior vice president of the firm. In 1999, Catz joined Oracle as its senior vice president. She joined the company's board of directors in 2001 and was named president in 2004.
<br/>Under Catz's direction, Oracle initiated more than 130 acquisitions and mergers over the next decade. The most well-known of these acquisitions was direct rival PeopleSoft, which Oracle acquired in 2004 for $10.3 billion.
<br/>In 2014, Catz became co-CEO of Oracle, along with Mark Hurd. She became the sole CEO in 2019, after Hurd's death. She also teaches accounting at the Stanford School of Business and was elected to the board of directors of the Walt Disney Co. in 2017.</p>

                    <div className="about">
                        <p>Reshma Saujani graduated from the University of Illinois with a bachelor's degree in political science and speech communication. From there, she received her Master of Public Policy degree from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.
                        <br/>
Saujani became the first Indian-American woman to run for U.S. Congress in 2010, when she campaigned for a New York House seat. During the race, she ran the first political campaign using tools such as Square to receive donations. And while visiting area schools during the race, she saw firsthand the gender gap in computer classes.
<br/>
In 2012, Saujani founded Girls Who Code to address that gender gap in the tech workforce, with programs for grades 3 all the way through college. The organization offers summer immersion and campus programs, online resources, books, after-school clubs and college alumni programs. To date, the organization has served more than 450,000 girls, approximately half of whom are from underserved communities made up of Black, Latina and low-income girls.
<br/>
In 2017, Saujani published her book, Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the World, promoting the tenets of her organization.</p>

                    <div className="about">
                        <p>Susan Wojcicki originally pursued a career in academia. She graduated with honors from Harvard University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and literature.
                        <br/>
Wojcicki developed an interest in technology during her senior year at Harvard. She went on to earn a Master of Science degree in economics from the University of California Santa Cruz and a Master of Business Administration degree from UCLA.
<br/>
After graduation, she returned to Silicon Valley to work in marketing at Intel. She later moved to Menlo Park, where she rented her garage as office space to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google. She became Google's 16th employee and first marketing manager, helping to develop Google Images and Google Books.
<br/>
Wojcicki helped develop AdWords and AdSense -- Google's advertising and analytics products. From there, she became Google's senior vice president of advertising and commerce, where she led the company's advertising and analytics division, including Google Video.
<br/>
She then proposed acquiring YouTube -- a direct competitor to Google Video -- rather than attempting to compete with it. In 2006, Google purchased YouTube for $1.65 billion.
<br/>
Wojcicki became YouTube's CEO in 2014. She continues to lead the Google subsidiary in its role as one of the most influential and frequently used platforms on the internet.</p>
